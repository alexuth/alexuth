## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**alexuth/alexuth** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I'm currently working on some web projects with Laravel and other mobile projects with Flutter.
- Currently i'm try to learning a little bit of evretything, trying not to become obsolete with new and not so new technology.
- TambiÃ©n estoy trabajando en mejorar mi ingles, asÃ­ que bienvenidas las obserbaciones de fallas en mi escritura.
